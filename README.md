# Conceptual model for optimization problems

Challenges:

- Clear and total separation between optimization problems (OP) and optimization methods (OM).
- An optimization problem encompasses:
  1. A sace composed of components,
  2. The components induce a neighborhood structure on the solution space,
  3. A partial solution structure, which provides methods to add and remove components
